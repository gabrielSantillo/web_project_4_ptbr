**Images**

In this project, I exported images directly from Figma. I optimized my images here to make my project load faster.


**Description**

This project consists of a blog page where the user can change their name and description, as well as add personal photos of the places they have traveled to.

**Features**

In this project, users can edit their profile, add travel photos, like them, and remove them. Modern and user-friendly form validation was implemented, where the user receives instant feedback while filling in the information they want to add to their blog. This facilitates user interaction with the page, as whenever they enter something that is not expected by the form, they receive an error message below the inputs. When they enter the expected input, the input field changes its color and the button becomes active, allowing the user to add a post or edit their profile.

**Technology Used**

This project was developed using HTML5 as the markup language. CSS was used as the styling language, and the BEM methodology was chosen for organizing classes, folders, and files. Lastly, Vanilla JavaScript was used as the language for page interactivity and responsiveness.
